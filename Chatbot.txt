ChatbotA chatbot (also known as atalkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity ) is a computerprogram or an artificial intelligence which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.[1] Such programs are oftendesigned to convincingly simulate how a human would behave as a conversational partner, thereby passing the Turing test. Chatbotsare typically used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Somechatterbots use sophisticatednatural language processingsystems, but many simpler systems scan for keywords within the input, thenpull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a database.The term "ChatterBot" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (creator of the first Verbot, Julia) in 1994 to describe theseconversational programs.[2] Today, most chatbots are either accessed via virtual assistants such as Google Assistant and AmazonAlexa, via messaging appssuch as Facebook Messengeror WeChat, or via individual organizations' apps and websites.[3][4] Chatbotscan be classified into usage categories such as conversational commerce(e-commerce via chat), analytics, communication, customersupport, design, developer tools, education, entertainment, finance, food, games, health, HR, marketing, news, personal, productivity,shopping, social, sports, travel and utilities.

This criterion depends on the ability of a computer program to impersonate a human in areal-time written conversation with a human judge, sufficiently well that the judge is unable to distinguish reliably—on the basis ofthe conversational content alone—between the program and a real human. The notoriety of Turing's proposed test stimulated greatinterest in Joseph Weizenbaum's program ELIZA, published in 1966, which seemed to be able to fool users into believing that theywere conversing with a real human. However Weizenbaum himself did not claim that ELIZA was genuinely intelligent, and theIntroduction to his paper presented it more as a debunking exercise:ContentsBackground[In] artificial intelligence ... machines are made to behave in wondrous ways, often sufficient to dazzle even the mostexperienced observer. But once a particular program is unmasked, once its inner workings are explained ... its magiccrumbles away; it stands revealed as a mere collection of procedures ... The observer says to himself "I could havewritten that". With that thought he moves the program in question from the shelf marked "intelligent", to that reservedfor curios ... The object of this paper is to cause just such a re-evaluation of the program about to be "explained". Fewprograms ever needed it more. [7]ELIZA's key method of operation (copied by chatbot designers ever since) involves the recognition of cue words or phrases in theinput, and the output of corresponding pre-prepared or pre-programmed responses that can move the conversation forward in anapparently meaningful way (e.g. by responding to any input that contains the word 'MOTHER' with 'TELL ME MORE ABOUTYOUR FAMILY').[8] Thus an illusion of understanding is generated, even though the processing involved has been merelysuperficial. ELIZA showed that such an illusion is surprisingly easy to generate, because human judges are so ready to give thebenefit of the doubt when conversational responses are capable of being interpr eted as "intelligent".Interface designers have come to appreciate that humans' readiness to interpret computer output as genuinely conversational—evenwhen it is actually based on rather simple pattern-matching—canbe exploited for useful purposes. Most people prefer to engage withprograms that are human-like, and this gives chatbot-style techniques a potentially useful role in interactive systems that need to elicitinformation from users, as long as that information is relatively straightforward and falls into predictable categories. Thus, forexample, online help systems can usefully employ chatbot techniques to identify the area of help that users require, potentiallyproviding a "friendlier" interface than a more formal search or menu system. This sort of usage holds the prospect of moving chatbottechnology from W eizenbaum's "shelf ... reserved for curios" to that marked "genuinely useful computational methods".The classic historic early chatbots are ELIZA (1966) and PARRY (1972).[9][10][11][12] More recent notable programs includeA.L.I.C.E., Jabberwacky and D.U.D.E (Agence Nationale de la Recherche and CNRS 2006). While ELIZA and PARRY were usedexclusively to simulate typed conversation, many chatbots now include functional features such as games and web searching abilities.In 1984, a book calledThe Policeman's Beard is Half Constructed was published, allegedly written by the chatbot Racter (though theprogram as released would not have been capable of doing so). [13]One pertinent field of AI research is natural language processing. Usually, weak AI fields employ specialized software orprogramminglanguages created specifically for the narrow function required. For example, A.L.I.C.E. uses a markup languagecalledAIML, which is specific to its function as a conversational agent, and has since been adopted by various other developers of, socalled, Alicebots. Nevertheless, A.L.I.C.E. is still purely based onpattern matchingtechniques without any reasoning capabilities, thesame technique ELIZA was using back in 1966. This is not strong AI, which would require sapience and logical reasoning abilities.Jabberwacky learns new responses and context based on real-time user interactions, rather than being driven from a static database.Some more recent chatbots also combine real-time learning with evolutionary algorithmsthat optimise their ability to communicatebased on each conversation held. Still, there is currently no general purpose conversational artificial intelligence, and some softwaredevelopers focus on the practical aspect,information retrieval.Chatbot competitions focus on the Turing test or more specific goals. Two such annual contests are the Loebner Prize and TheChatterbox Challenge (of fline since 2015, materials can still be found from web archives). [14]According to Forrester (2015), AI will replace 16 percent of American jobs by the end of the decade.[15] Chatbots have been used inapplications such as customer service, sales and product education. However, a study conducted by Narrative Science in 2015 foundthat 80 percent of their respondents believe AI improves worker performance and creates jobs.DevelopmentApplicationMany companies' chatbots run on messaging apps like Facebook Messenger (since2016), WeChat (since 2013),[16] WhatsApp, LiveChat, Kik, Slack, Line, Telegram, orsimply via SMS. They are used forB2C customer service, sales and marketing. [17]In 2016, Facebook Messenger allowed developers to place chatbots on their platform.There were 30,000 bots created for Messenger in the first six months, rising to100,000 by September 2017.[18]Since September 2017, this has also been as part of a pilot program on WhatsApp.Airlines KLM and Aeroméxico both announced their participation in thetesting;[19][20][21][22] both airlines had previously launched customer services on theFacebook Messengerplatform.The bots usually appear as one of the user's contacts, but can sometimes act asparticipants in a group chat.Many banks and insurers, media and e-commerce companies, airlines and hotelchains, retailers, health care providers, government entities and restaurant chains haveused chatbots to answer simple questions, increase customer engagement,[23] forpromotion, and to offer additional ways to order f rom them.[24][25]A 2017 study showed 4% of companies used chatbots.[26] According to a 2016 study,80% of businesses said they intended to have one by 2020. [27]Previous generations of chatbots were present on company websites, e.g. Ask Jennfrom Alaska Airlineswhich debuted in 2008[28] or Expedia's virtual customer serviceagent which launched in 2011.[28][29] The newer generation of chatbots includes IBM Watson-powered "Rocky", introduced inFebruary 2017 by the New York City-based e-commerce company Rare Carat to provide information to prospective diamondbuyers.[30][31]Other companies explore ways they can use chatbots internally, for example for Customer Support, Human Resources, or even inInternet-of-Things(IoT) projects. Overstock.com, for one, has reportedly launched a chatbot named Mila to automate certain simpleyet time-consuming processes when requesting for a sick leave.[32] Other large companies such as Lloyds Banking Group, RoyalBank of Scotland, Renault and Citroën are now using automated online assistants instead of call centres with humans to provide afirst point of contact. A SaaS chatbot business ecosystem has been steadily growing since the F8 Conference when Zuckerbergunveiled that Messenger would allow chatbots into the app. [33]Chatbots have also been incorporated into devices not primarily meant for computing such as toys. [34]Hello Barbie is an Internet-connectedversion of the doll that uses a chatbot provided by the company ToyTalk,[35] which previouslyused the chatbot for a range of smartphone-basedcharacters for children.[36] These characters' behaviors are constrained by a set ofrules that in effect emulate a particular character a nd produce a storyline. [37]IBM's Watson computer has been used as the basis for chatbot-based educational toys for companies such as CogniToys[34] intendedto interact with children for educational purposes. [38]Aeromexico airline chatbot runningon Facebook Messenger, March2018Messaging appsAs part of company apps and websitesCompany internal platformsToysThe process of creating a chatbot follows a pattern similar to the development of a web page or a mobile app. It can be divided intoDesign, Building, Analytics and Maintenance. [39]The chatbot design is the process that defines the interaction between the user and the chatbot.[40] The chatbot designer will definethe chatbot personality, the questions that will be asked to the users, and the overall interaction.[41][42] It can be viewed as a subset ofthe conversational design. In order to speed up this process, designers can use dedicated chatbot design tools, that allow forimmediate preview, team collaboration and video export.[43] An important part of the chatbot design is also centered around usertesting. User testing can be performed following the same principles that guide the user testing of graphical interfaces. [44]The process of building a chatbot can be divided into two main tasks: understanding the user's intent and producing the correctanswer. The first task involves understandingthe user input. In order to properly understand a user input in a free text form, a NaturalLanguage Processing Engine can be used.[45] The second task may involve different approaches depending on the type of theresponse that the chatbot will generate.The usage of the chatbot can be monitored in order to spot potential flaws or problems. It can also provide useful insights that canimprove the final user experience. [46]To keep chatbots up to speed with changing company products and services, traditional chatbot development platforms requireongoing maintenance. This can either be in the form of an ongoing service provider or for larger enterprises in the form of an inhouse chatbot training team. [47] To eliminate these costs, some startups are experimentingwith Artificial Intelligenceto develop selflearning chatbots, particularly inCustomer Serviceapplications.The process of building, testing and deploying chatbots can be done on cloud based chatbot development platforms[48] offered bycloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) providers such as Yekaliva, Oracle Cloud Platform, SnatchBot[49] and IBM Watson.[50][51][52]These cloud platforms provide Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence and Mobile Backend as a Service for chatbotdevelopment.There are many APIs available for building your own chatbots, such as AARC. [53]Malicious chatbots are frequently used to fill chat rooms with spam and advertisements, by mimicking human behaviour andconversations or to entice people into revealing personal information, such as bank account numbers. They are commonly found onYahoo! Messenger, Windows Live Messenger, AOL Instant Messenger and other instant messagingprotocols. There has also been apublished report of a chatbot used in a fake personal ad on a dating service's website.
